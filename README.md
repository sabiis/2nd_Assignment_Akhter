# Description

This is the 2nd assignment that I am working on. We are learning about GitHub and the commands that we can use on our local machine to add, commit and push files to the GitHub repository.

That is what I will be doing in this project. There will be 3 files that I will be adding to this repository (2nd_Assignment_Akhter). I have already created a README.md file. I will be creating a .gitignore file. The 3rd file that I already have in my local machine is a python script I created in my last course which is the BlackJack Game. Kindly note that there are no validation checks on the inputs. Therefore any wrong key input would result in an error. Other than that, hope you have fun playing the game, as I had fun creating it :)

# Instructions


* The possible card values range from 1 to 10 with face cards (King, Queen, Jack (Represented graphically)) and, unlike a real deck, the  probability of drawing a card is equal
* The game begins by dealing two visible cards to the player (face up), and two cards to the dealer. However, in the case of the dealer, one card is visible to other players while the other is hidden.
* The player decides whether to "hit" (draw another card), or "stand" which ends their turn.
* The player may hit any number of times. Should the total of the cards exceed 21, the player "busts" and loses the game to the dealer.
* If the player reaches 21, the player stands
* The dealer's turn begins by revealing the hidden card
* The dealer must hit if the total is 16 or less, and must stand if the value is 17 or more
* The dealer wins all ties (i.e. if both the dealer and the player reach 21, the dealer wins)
* The program indicates who the winner is and asks to play again.
* The Ace card can either take the value of 1 or 11 depending on the scenario.
